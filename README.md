<b>Maintainerr</b> makes managing your media easy. Create custom rules with parameters across different services, show matching media on the Plex home screen for a given amount of days and handle the deletion.

> Maintainerr is early alpha software, expect bugs.

# Features
- Configure rules specific to your needs
- Manually add media to a collection, in case it's not included in your rules
- Exclude  media for some or all rules
- Show a plex collection, containing selected media, on the Plex home screen for a specific duration
- Remove or unmonitor media from Radarr
- Remove or unmonitor media from Sonarr
- Clear requests from Overseerr
- Delete files from disk

Currently, Maintainerr supports rules across these apps :

- Plex
- Overseerr
- Radarr
- Sonarr

# Installation

Docker images for amd64, arm64 & armv7 are availabile under jorenn92/maintainerr. <br />
Data is saved under /opt/data, a volume should be created to make the configuration persistent.

For more information visit the [installation guide](docs/2-getting-started/1-installation/Installation.md) or navigate to \<maintainerr_url\>:\<port\>/docs after starting your Maintainerr container.

> Armv7 builds are temporarily disabled due to a problem with NextJS. If you want to use this architecture, you'll have to stick with version 1.1.2 for now.
